At its heart is `map()` and friends: functions for the common pattern of iterating over a vector or list, doing something to each element, and then storing the results. These functions let you iterate efficiently and with less code. As Jenny Bryan once said, “of course someone needs to write `for` loops; it doesn’t have to be you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Code of Conduct: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\"&gt;https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Venue**&lt;br/&gt;Address: WeWork One Culver, 10000 Washington Boulevard, Culver City, CA 90232&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you arrive: Bring a photo ID and scan it at the guest registration tablets at the front desk for the Meetup event.

CNNs are used for object recognition in an image. Autonomous cars use CNN technology to navigate smoothly on the roads. There are many biomedical applications where CNN is used for image analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The motivation for CNN originated from the Hubel &amp;amp; Wiesel (Noble prize winners 1981) study of the human visual system. This research leads to the idea that if we apply the convolution operations to the image and then feed them to neural networks, the accuracy of object identification increases. This idea started the revolution of CNN.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the architecture of CNN. The Convolution and Pooling operations will be covered. Tools for building a CNN are R and TensorFlow. The implementation of CNN in R will be demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;# Talk 2&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;## Title: Speeding up R with Rcpp&lt;br/&gt;## Speaker: Luke Klein&lt;br/&gt;## Abstract&lt;br/&gt;R is a beautiful and flexible language, and it is improving all the time. However, some processes (e.g. repeated function calls) can add a lot of computational overhead. Rcpp is a package for extending R with C++ functions which is utilized by over 1000 packages on CRAN. Many R data types and objects can be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing new code for people just learning C++, as well as easier integration of third-party libraries. In this talk, I'll demonstrate how easy it is to get started with Rcpp and what kind of performance boosts one can achieve. If you're taking aim at levelling-up your function writing skills then Rcpp is the place to start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;# Sponsor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kforce is an international staffing firm specialized in the IT and Finance and Accounting space.

Would you like to get together with a few friends and learn together? I have been starting to learn R and Python for data science and following the typical route of videos and practice projects. I really want to ramp up my learning and exposure to different ways. Here is my proposal:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Gather a small group of 2-5 and learn together.&lt;br/&gt;- Meet at a coffee shop, library, or some other space that has Wi-Fi.&lt;br/&gt;- Pick a project, data set or problem, then work to solve it with different tools.&lt;br/&gt;- Keep it fluid and informal.&lt;br/&gt;- Meet on a regular basis, say weekly to start, and adjust as needed.&lt;br/&gt;- Aim to keep the meetings 2-4 hours long, but this can be adjusted to the project or group. People can come and go as needed.&lt;br/&gt;- It does not have to be the same people each time, so you only have to commit to going once to check it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are you interested? Show up at the meeting spot, have some coffee, meet new friends and bring a project or question.&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;• What we'll do&lt;br/&gt;Liz will be talking about R cheatsheets!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• What to bring&lt;br/&gt;If you wish to bring a laptop to follow along, code and slides will be posted ~24 hours in advance at &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/TampaUseRs/TampaUseRs/tree/master/meetups\" class=\"linkified\"&gt;https://github.com/TampaUseRs/TampaUseRs/tree/master/meetups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;For our Spring meet-up, we have four guest speakers from academia, industry and government each giving a short talk on how they use R.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone is welcome!

It creates a static website you can host on any server with minimal effort. In this talk we'll cover what blogdown is and why you might want to use it, look at some easy ways to get started, and share resources to take you further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Carroll&lt;br/&gt;Got lots of loops or repetitive calculating to do? In this talk I'll walk through the basics of synchronous vs asynchronous processing and demonstrate some ways to perform calculations in parallel (or offsite) based on the {future} package.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This R meet-up is governed by the R Community Code of Conduct: &lt;a href=\"https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct\" class=\"linkified\"&gt;https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;Les cartes sont omniprésentes, mais les règles qui président à leur construction restent souvent méconnues. Avec R, faire des cartes est simple. Faire de \"belles\" cartes plus compliqué. Faire des cartes \"pertinentes\" plus encore. Et quid de l'interactivité ? En 1h, nous nous intéressons / parcourrons l'univers de la cartographie pour le data-scientist et expliquerons les erreurs les plus courantes. Nous finirons par une exploration de ce que peut apporter l'interactivité avec des exemples en d3.js.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arthur Katossky est enseignant en informatique, statistique et économie à l'ENSAI (Rennes) où il donne entre autres les cours de visualisation de données.

Containers allow software to be used in a reproducible, reliable and isolated fashion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bioconductor also produces containers which replicate their build machines to allow developers contributing to the project to test their changes more aggressively before being put in production. These containers will provide the base infrastructure for cloud/web platforms in the near future. This talk will highlight how to use these containers effectively through docker on your local machine and demo their usage in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nitesh Turaga&lt;br/&gt;Bioconductor Core Team, Roswell Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bioconductor.org/about/core-team/\" class=\"linkified\"&gt;https://www.bioconductor.org/about/core-team/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm a Senior Programmer in the Core team at the Bioconductor Project.

In the end, we get a package that can easily be applied to functional data and elsewhere. This is work in progress and feedback will be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xaringan shenanigans by Claus Thorn Ekstrøm&lt;br/&gt;=============================================&lt;br/&gt;R provides several possibilities for using Rmarkdown to quickly create&lt;br/&gt;excellent presentations combining R code, R output, mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;animations, and interactive widgets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this code-along I will show how to use the package xaringan to&lt;br/&gt;build simple, elegant, Rmarkdown-driven presentations based on the&lt;br/&gt;remark.js presentation framework. We will cover formatting, widgets,&lt;br/&gt;caveats, show some tips and tricks, and how to customise your own&lt;br/&gt;presentation template.&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;The Regional Group - MWSUG is holding its annual conference in Chicago this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visit: mwsug.org for event details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key dates to be aware of:&lt;br/&gt;05/01/2019 Abstract submission deadline&lt;br/&gt;04/16/2019 Scholarship application opens&lt;br/&gt;05/24/2019 Presenters will be notified of abstract acceptance&lt;br/&gt;06/20/2019 Conference Registration opens&lt;br/&gt;06/22/2019 Scholarship application deadline&lt;br/&gt;06/29/2019 Scholarship winners will be notified&lt;br/&gt;07/20/2019 Final Papers due from authors&lt;br/&gt;08/31/2019 Early Registration ends&lt;br/&gt;09/09/2019 Guaranteed hotel rate ends&lt;br/&gt;09/13/2019 Presentation Slides due from authors&lt;br/&gt;09/20/2019 Regular Registration ends&lt;br/&gt;09/29/2019 MWSUG 2019 Conference Begins&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you cant attend SAS Global Forum see if you can attend MWSUG!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This event is not organized by our group.&lt;br/&gt;We are part of the SAS User Groups and agree to help promote and inform local users.

But that doesn't mean one shouldn't try. Sometimes business constraints and lack of adequate tools make ETL orchestration far more painful than it needs to be. That is why David Denton is currently endeavoring to build a robust, portable, ETL Machine with R &amp;amp; Shiny. This is a work in progress that he is sharing in hopes of eliciting some helpful feedback (booing and hissing is acceptable as well). Part 1 will focus on writing versatile, well-documented functions in R.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David Denton currently works as a data engineer at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pizza and beverages will be provided.&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;Our next Meetup will be at SelectHealth in Murray. There is visitor parking available in front of SelectHealth. Or, if you want to get your steps in for the day you can take the FrontRunner or Trax blue or green line to Murray Central Station.

Genetic diversity is key for creating healthy and resilient populations, meaning genetic analyses are critical for informing effective ecosystem restoration. The size of genetic data, especially with recent advances, and complexity of analyses requires specialized software. In the past, analyses have required multiple software programs with different user interfaces and data formats. R has not only made genetic analyses more streamlined and straight forward, but has also increased reproducibility and provided the opportunity for more innovative approaches. From data management to data visualization and publication, R is the future for genetic analysis in conservation sciences and across other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) David Selby - Modelling research funding with R&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The location of the meetup is room MUIR-112, Muirhead Tower, University of Birmingham campus (B15 2TN).

Choose one or attend both!**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Leah Welty will present: \"Collaborative Reproducibility: Connecting R/R Markdown and Microsoft Word using StatTag\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although R Markdown can render documents to Microsoft Word, R/R Markdown users must sometimes transcribe statistical content in to separate Microsoft Word documents (e.g., documents drafted by colleagues in Word, or documents that must be prepared in Word), a process that is error prone, irreproducible, and inefficient. We will present StatTag (www.stattag.org), an open source, free, and user-friendly program we developed to address this problem. StatTag establishes a bi-directional link between R/RMarkdown files and a Word document, and supports a reproducible pipeline even when: (1) statistical results must be included and updated in Word documents that were never generated from Markdown; and (2) text in Word files generated from R/RMarkdown has departed substantially from original Markdown content, for example through tracked changes or comments. We will demonstrate how to use StatTag to connect R/RMarkdown and Word files so that all files can be edited separately, but statistical content –values, tables, figures, and verbatim output– can be updated automatically in Word. Using practical examples, we will also illustrate how to use StatTag to view, edit, and rerun R/RMarkdown code directly from Word. The talk will also include an overview of reproducible research in the collaborative research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About the Speaker&lt;br/&gt;Leah J. Welty, PhD is Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, Department of Preventive Medicine and in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and is the Director of the Biostatistics Collaboration Center within the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. She is also the Immediate Past President of the Association of Clinical and Translational Statisticians. She earned her PhD in statistics from the University of Chicago, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research interests include longitudinal and multilevel models, psychiatric epidemiology, and the development of reproducible research tools for clinical and translational science. She is the lead biostatistician for the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a large-scale longitudinal study of psychiatric disorders and risky behaviors in delinquent youth. She has led the development of StatTag, a free, open-source program to support reproducible research in clinical and translational science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schedule&lt;br/&gt;4:30-5pm - Food, Intros &amp;amp; Announcements&lt;br/&gt;5-6pm - StatTag&lt;br/&gt;6-6:30pm - Socializing/Networking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**This event is child-friendly!&lt;br/&gt;We realize this is an earlier start time than our normal events and strive to make it accessible to all.

A model for streaming data should be fast to compute and adaptive to the changing nature of the data. These two objectives are hard to achieve simultaneously. Conventional statistical methods often assume that all data have already been collected and stored in the computer memory. Existing models for streaming data, are mostly proposed by computer scientists and only address the computational challenge. Without knowing their theoretical properties, it is hard to predict when these methods will succeed.&lt;br/&gt;We develop computationally efficient models with theoretical guarantee, with more flexible nonparametric models, and investigate their theoretical properties using infill asymptotics. Computational properties of the models are shown using computer simulations and then applied to some real data examples to show their power for modelling real-world problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talk 2: Rushani Wijesuriya – Multiple imputation in three-level data structures&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Multilevel data with three levels of hierarchy are common in health research studies. A common problem in such studies is the presence of missing data and often handled with multiple Imputation (MI). To our knowledge there are only two MI implementations that are specialized for imputing missing data in a three-level setting (one within R and the other in the stand-alone software Blimp) and a lack of sufficient guidance for practitioners regarding the settings for which each of these approaches is appropriate. We investigate the performance of alternative MI approaches for handling three-level incomplete data by means of a simulation study under a number of different scenarios. Based on a case study from the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study (CATS), we compared a range of currently available multilevel MI methods designed for single-level and two-level data combined with ad hoc approaches, such as the use of dummy indicators (DI) for school clusters or a just another variable (JAV) approach to repeated measures, in terms of bias and precision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talk 3: Ravindi Nanayakkara – Stochastic modelling and statistical analysis of cosmic microwave background data&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the radiation from the universe since 380,000 years from its birth. In 2009, the European Space Agency launched the mission Planck to study the CMB thoroughly. The aim of the mission was to verify the standard model of cosmology using a detailed resolution of observations and to find out fluctuations from the specified standard model of cosmology. The main statistical model used to describe the CMB data is isotropic Gaussian fields. A random field can be defined as a stochastic process; indexed by a spatial variable. The Rényi function plays a central role in multifractal analysis, since the multifractal formalism in the theory of random cascades can be understood in the sense of the Legendre transform of the Rényi function. For the Rényi function on the sphere, there are three models where the Rényi function is known explicitly. They are Log-Normal model, Log-Gamma model and Log-Negative-Inverted-Gamma model. Our research aims to check the Gaussianity of the CMB Radiation data collected from the Planck mission. We discuss the statistical properties of random fields on spheres using high frequency asymptotics for angular spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;Join R-Ladies Philly for another evening of coffee, conversation, and coding!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We will meet at Good Karma (928 Pine Street) from 5:30-7:30 PM on Tuesday August 24, 2019 for an informal opportunity to share current R projects with one another, debug and review code, and network (and of course indulge in delicious coffee and pastry).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please bring your laptop.

Come and meet us because we have two speakers excited to share their research about the application of Big Data and Machine Learning in their respective field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our first speaker is Joji Teves, a current Ph.D. fellow at the University of Copenhagen – iMED program. As a trained cellular biologist in a computational biology group, Joji is currently exploring big data tools to map out genomic marks of healthy and diseased cell states. Prior to moving to Copenhagen, Joji earned her Master’s at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, USA where she studied Patient-derived biospecimens from Parkinson’s disease patients and studied cellular marks related to cellular autophagy and UV damage in comparison to healthy age-match cohorts. As a “data science” noob, she takes on a different perspective on how data science tools can be applied in biology to study health and diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our second speaker is Jhaz Petersen - a data-savvy Marketer who is a Graduate from Copenhagen Business School. She studied the traditional research methodologies but wanted to challenge that with the current technologies available. Therefore, she applies Machine Learning Algorithms in analyzing Big Data to solve Sales and Marketing case problems. She would like to share her original framework on how businesses in every industry can leverage their existing big data to create a business strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Program:&lt;br/&gt;17:00 - 17:15 Welcome&lt;br/&gt;17:15 - 17:35 Presentation by Joji Marie Teves - \"Exploring Computational&lt;br/&gt;Biology to study Cellular Health and Disease\"&lt;br/&gt;17:35 - 17:45 BREAK&lt;br/&gt;17:45 - 18:05 Presentation by Jhaz Petersen - \"Leveraging Big Data and Machine Learning in Sales &amp;amp; Marketing - Application of Market Basket Analysis, Clustering &amp;amp; 3D Customer Segmentation in R\"&lt;br/&gt;18:05 - 18:30 Closing and Networking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coffee and snacks will be served.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;R Ladies CPH&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;Sa zadovoljstvom vas pozivamo na prvu radionicu, u nizu predstojećih, koja je posvećena osnovama programskog jezika R.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Radionica će se održati u Startit Centru u Novom Sadu[masked]. godine sa početkom u 16h, a održaće je Ranka Medenica Todorović i Maja Pokuševski.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prvi deo radionice biće posvećen instalaciji R-a, pokretanju prezentacije napravljene u R-u, upoznavanju sa R okruženjem, učitavanju podataka različitih formata i osnovnim konceptima rada u okruženju.

In this two-day workshop, we will learn some basics about Bayesian statistics, with a focus on using a Bayesian approach to statistical modelling. We will use brms package by Paul Bürkner, which uses Stan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the first day, we will have an intro to Bayesian statistics and statistical modelling. We will be introduced to brms using simple variants of the general linear model, and multi-level models, with a normal response distribution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the second day, we will take a look at the binomial and Poisson distribution for count data, and learn when we should used them and how to do so using brms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The workshop will have small lectures and some practical exercises so the participants can fit their own models with brms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This workshop will be facilitated by Marie Beisemann. She's about to start her Phd in Statistics at the Technical University of Dortmund, Germany, right after finishing he Master's degree in psychology at the University of Münster.

Here is the second of our September events!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For our second event this month, we welcome Alison Hill, who will give a seminar about plots and how to improve them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this talk, Alison will talk about one plot’s life cycle, from a sad Powerpoint slide to an Excel chart and finally to the finished product made with the ggplot2 package in R. Along the way, she will discuss why each version of the plot fails in different ways and how each iteration improved on the last one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alison is a data scientist &amp;amp; professional educator at RStudio, where she works to help people learn and use programming to do better work in less time, with less friction, and (perhaps) more joy. She loves working with data scientists across the spectrum- from beginners to advanced users- and particularly enjoy using software tools to create educational materials that enlighten and engage learners. Topics Alison teaches range from literate programming to machine learning. Her teaching materials have been used by NASA, Pew Research Center, University of Oregon, and now RStudio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This event will be hosted by our fantastic sponsor Nous.

A surprisingly big gulf separates \"95% model accuracy\" from questions like, \"Why was this particular image of a dog mislabeled as a wolf?\", \"What features contributed to flagging a transaction as fraud?\", or \"How much does choice of major contribute to a student's likelihood of completing their degree program?\". If you can't answer such questions, should you really trust your model for making important decisions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We will start by checking in on a couple of ongoing projects to hear about recent progress and current challenges. Then we will resume our deep dive into SHAP, a recently developed method for interpreting machine learning models such as XGBoost. Discussion will center around the paper (&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03888.pdf\" class=\"linkified\"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03888.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) and accompanying blog post (&lt;a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretable-machine-learning-with-xgboost-9ec80d148d27\" class=\"linkified\"&gt;https://towardsdatascience.com/interpretable-machine-learning-with-xgboost-9ec80d148d27&lt;/a&gt;).

We will begin with the basics on networks and clustering before moving on to the algorithm and implementation that we chose to analyse the Scottish Economy. We then give an introduction to R Shiny, a package used to create interactive web apps, and show off our network visualisation and editing app. Finally, we will discuss how we can improve this ongoing project and future applications of our networking efforts in analysing the Scottish economy. We have used the `NetworkToolbox` library for the implementation of the main algorithm. The packages `dplyr` and `tidyr` were used for data manipulation, `plotly` and `igraph` are used for visualisations, and of course `Shiny` is used to build a convenient user interface. All data used will be made available for download, and the code will be shared via GitHub.&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;Scotland Fintech Festival - FinTech Scotland - &lt;a href=\"https://www.fintechscotland.com/scotland-fintech-festival/\" class=\"linkified\"&gt;https://www.fintechscotland.com/scotland-fintech-festival/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scotland Fintech Festival will take place in September 2019 between the 9th and the 27th across Scotland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The festival will contain conferences, meet-ups, morning breakfast sessions, evening networking events and much more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scotland Data Science &amp;amp; Technology Meetup are delighted to have Doug Gowans - Technical Partner Manager - UiPath Alex Croucher - Director - VKY Intelligent Automation presenting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Presentation 1 - Bringing an automation first mindset to finance.

Early diagnosis in these cases significantly increases the chances of survival. The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumours into malignant or benign. Artificial Intelligence can dramatically improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79% accuracy while using artificial intelligence based diagnosis, it is possible to achieve 91% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NASSCOM CoE – IoT &amp;amp; AI, Gurugram &amp;amp; Equonix Tech Lab have organised a LIVE CODING SESSION on BREAST CANCER DETECTION&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SESSION FEES : ₹300&lt;br/&gt;PAYMENT CAN ALSO BE MADE ON THE SPOT&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;REGISTRATION via &lt;a href=\"https://forms.gle/8VxrTkrxu5ppGTYR8\" class=\"linkified\"&gt;https://forms.gle/8VxrTkrxu5ppGTYR8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AGENDA&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;09:30am - 10:00am | REGISTRATION&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;10:00am - 12:00pm | SESSION 1&lt;br/&gt;To understand this problem set and understanding the Machine learning approaches, researchers worldwide are developing autonomous, user-friendly solution for cancer detection.

This is known as “AI on the edge” and could benefit from specialized, fixed chip architectures that are more efficient. Datacentres that power “AI on the cloud” on the other hand, would run on fully scalable and programmable chip architectures, to handle a much broader spectrum of learning tasks.

I will be presenting some examples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Data wrangling is a critical foundation of data science, and wrangling of categorical data is an important component of this process. However, categorical data can introduce unique issues in data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper discusses common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the ‘tidyverse.’ We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;This is intended to give a crash course to R users with none/little experience with R or programming, and end with visualizing a dataset. This is the first of a few courses we have planned in the coming weeks introducing people to critical R programming skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the more advanced useRs, we ask that while we teach, you flex your R muscles and try to come up with a unique way to visualize a data set that will be revealed at the beginning of the meetup. We will give the opportunity to share your creations at the end of the presentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the presentation we will have some networking and chatting time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are limited in the size of the meeting room, so please only RSVP if you know you will be making it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are wanting to have your own meetup to discuss the cool ways you are using R, reach out to Ellis Hughes via Meetup.com!&lt;/p&gt; ","&lt;p&gt;Government Advances in Statistical Programming (GASP!)

More info on the book below. We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Amazon about the book: \"Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women†‹, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.\"&lt;/p&gt;

At its heart is `map()` and friends: functions for the common pattern of iterating over a vector or list, doing something to each element, and then storing the results. These functions let you iterate efficiently and with less code. As Jenny Bryan once said, “of course someone needs to write `for` loops; it doesn’t have to be you.”<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>**Venue**<br/>Address: WeWork One Culver, 10000 Washington Boulevard, Culver City, CA 90232<\/p> <p>When you arrive: Bring a photo ID and scan it at the guest registration tablets at the front desk for the Meetup event.

CNNs are used for object recognition in an image. Autonomous cars use CNN technology to navigate smoothly on the roads. There are many biomedical applications where CNN is used for image analysis.<\/p> <p>The motivation for CNN originated from the Hubel &amp; Wiesel (Noble prize winners 1981) study of the human visual system. This research leads to the idea that if we apply the convolution operations to the image and then feed them to neural networks, the accuracy of object identification increases. This idea started the revolution of CNN.<\/p> <p>This talk will cover the architecture of CNN. The Convolution and Pooling operations will be covered. Tools for building a CNN are R and TensorFlow. The implementation of CNN in R will be demonstrated.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Speeding up R with Rcpp<br/>## Speaker: Luke Klein<br/>## Abstract<br/>R is a beautiful and flexible language, and it is improving all the time. However, some processes (e.g. repeated function calls) can add a lot of computational overhead. Rcpp is a package for extending R with C++ functions which is utilized by over 1000 packages on CRAN. Many R data types and objects can be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing new code for people just learning C++, as well as easier integration of third-party libraries. In this talk, I'll demonstrate how easy it is to get started with Rcpp and what kind of performance boosts one can achieve. If you're taking aim at levelling-up your function writing skills then Rcpp is the place to start.<\/p> <p># Sponsor<\/p> <p>Kforce is an international staffing firm specialized in the IT and Finance and Accounting space.

Please join us as Rinu Fasehun, Senior Data Scientist at USAA, gives a talk on “Why Data Science cannot ignore Statistics”.<\/p> <p>Statistics is the science of data and statistical methods are a key part of data science, yet a lot of data scientists’ misconceptions regarding statistics involve coding algorithms without learning the prerequisites. With the rise of big data, citizen data scientists, and tools allowing for easy implementation of powerful machine learning algorithms, it’s worth asking if statistical concerns are being overlooked. Using examples, I will discuss how statistics and statistical methods play a key role in data science. I will illustrate the most common types of statistical mistakes in the data science process that people in the field tend to make.<\/p> <p> Bias/ Sampling<br/> Exploratory data analysis<br/> Feature engineering<br/> Simpson’s Paradox<br/> Coding algorithms without knowing what goes on under the hood<\/p> <p>Prior to joining USAA as a senior data scientist, Rinu worked as an Analytic Consultant in the Life and Health Services industry where she was responsible for developing statistical models for health outcomes, call center optimization techniques and disease management program evaluations.<br/>Rinu holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Statistics and a Masters of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Lagos, Nigeria and a Masters degree in Statistics from Columbia University New York.<\/p> ","how_to_find_us":"CSI 104","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1568368943000,"duration":7200000,"id":"264809155","name":"SK-Burn: Tips for new data scientists","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1569362400000,"local_date":"2019-09-24","local_time":"18:00","updated":1568665359000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":18,"venue":{"id":26045885,"name":"CIC Cambridge","lat":42.3622817993164,"lon":-71.0811157226562,"repinned":true,"address_1":"101 Main St","city":"Cambridge","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"02142","state":"MA"},"group":{"created":1363739894000,"name":"Open Data Science (Hosted by ODSC)","id":7698382,"join_mode":"open","lat":42.3699989318848,"lon":-71.0899963378906,"urlname":"open-data-odsc","who":"Data Miners","localized_location":"Cambridge, MA","state":"MA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/open-data-odsc/events/264809155/","description":"<p>Kaggle Days Meetup in Boston #1<\/p> <p>Speaker: Raymond Grossman, Machine Learning Engineer at Kensho Technologies<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymond-grossman-bb4664114/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymond-grossman-bb4664114/<\/a><\/p> <p>Topic:<br/>SK-Burn: Tips for new data scientists<\/p> <p>Schedule:<br/>6:00pm - 6:30pm - ODSC and LogicAI Intro, Pizza &amp; Refreshments<br/>6:30pm - 7:20pm - Talk<br/>7:20pm - 7:30pm - Q&amp;A<br/>7:30pm - 8:00pm - Networking<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Raymond Grossman has been an avid machine and deep learning practitioner since graduating from Princeton Mathematics in 2016.

Genetic diversity is key for creating healthy and resilient populations, meaning genetic analyses are critical for informing effective ecosystem restoration. The size of genetic data, especially with recent advances, and complexity of analyses requires specialized software. In the past, analyses have required multiple software programs with different user interfaces and data formats. R has not only made genetic analyses more streamlined and straight forward, but has also increased reproducibility and provided the opportunity for more innovative approaches. From data management to data visualization and publication, R is the future for genetic analysis in conservation sciences and across other disciplines.<\/p> <p>2) David Selby - Modelling research funding with R<\/p> <p>The location of the meetup is room MUIR-112, Muirhead Tower, University of Birmingham campus (B15 2TN).

Choose one or attend both!**<\/p> <p>Dr. Leah Welty will present: \"Collaborative Reproducibility: Connecting R/R Markdown and Microsoft Word using StatTag\"<\/p> <p>Although R Markdown can render documents to Microsoft Word, R/R Markdown users must sometimes transcribe statistical content in to separate Microsoft Word documents (e.g., documents drafted by colleagues in Word, or documents that must be prepared in Word), a process that is error prone, irreproducible, and inefficient. We will present StatTag (www.stattag.org), an open source, free, and user-friendly program we developed to address this problem. StatTag establishes a bi-directional link between R/RMarkdown files and a Word document, and supports a reproducible pipeline even when: (1) statistical results must be included and updated in Word documents that were never generated from Markdown; and (2) text in Word files generated from R/RMarkdown has departed substantially from original Markdown content, for example through tracked changes or comments. We will demonstrate how to use StatTag to connect R/RMarkdown and Word files so that all files can be edited separately, but statistical content –values, tables, figures, and verbatim output– can be updated automatically in Word. Using practical examples, we will also illustrate how to use StatTag to view, edit, and rerun R/RMarkdown code directly from Word. The talk will also include an overview of reproducible research in the collaborative research.<\/p> <p>About the Speaker<br/>Leah J. Welty, PhD is Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, Department of Preventive Medicine and in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and is the Director of the Biostatistics Collaboration Center within the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. She is also the Immediate Past President of the Association of Clinical and Translational Statisticians. She earned her PhD in statistics from the University of Chicago, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research interests include longitudinal and multilevel models, psychiatric epidemiology, and the development of reproducible research tools for clinical and translational science. She is the lead biostatistician for the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a large-scale longitudinal study of psychiatric disorders and risky behaviors in delinquent youth. She has led the development of StatTag, a free, open-source program to support reproducible research in clinical and translational science.<\/p> <p>Schedule<br/>4:30-5pm - Food, Intros &amp; Announcements<br/>5-6pm - StatTag<br/>6-6:30pm - Socializing/Networking<\/p> <p>**This event is child-friendly!<br/>We realize this is an earlier start time than our normal events and strive to make it accessible to all.

A model for streaming data should be fast to compute and adaptive to the changing nature of the data. These two objectives are hard to achieve simultaneously. Conventional statistical methods often assume that all data have already been collected and stored in the computer memory. Existing models for streaming data, are mostly proposed by computer scientists and only address the computational challenge. Without knowing their theoretical properties, it is hard to predict when these methods will succeed.<br/>We develop computationally efficient models with theoretical guarantee, with more flexible nonparametric models, and investigate their theoretical properties using infill asymptotics. Computational properties of the models are shown using computer simulations and then applied to some real data examples to show their power for modelling real-world problems.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Rushani Wijesuriya – Multiple imputation in three-level data structures<\/p> <p>Multilevel data with three levels of hierarchy are common in health research studies. A common problem in such studies is the presence of missing data and often handled with multiple Imputation (MI). To our knowledge there are only two MI implementations that are specialized for imputing missing data in a three-level setting (one within R and the other in the stand-alone software Blimp) and a lack of sufficient guidance for practitioners regarding the settings for which each of these approaches is appropriate. We investigate the performance of alternative MI approaches for handling three-level incomplete data by means of a simulation study under a number of different scenarios. Based on a case study from the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study (CATS), we compared a range of currently available multilevel MI methods designed for single-level and two-level data combined with ad hoc approaches, such as the use of dummy indicators (DI) for school clusters or a just another variable (JAV) approach to repeated measures, in terms of bias and precision.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Ravindi Nanayakkara – Stochastic modelling and statistical analysis of cosmic microwave background data<\/p> <p>The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the radiation from the universe since 380,000 years from its birth. In 2009, the European Space Agency launched the mission Planck to study the CMB thoroughly. The aim of the mission was to verify the standard model of cosmology using a detailed resolution of observations and to find out fluctuations from the specified standard model of cosmology. The main statistical model used to describe the CMB data is isotropic Gaussian fields. A random field can be defined as a stochastic process; indexed by a spatial variable. The Rényi function plays a central role in multifractal analysis, since the multifractal formalism in the theory of random cascades can be understood in the sense of the Legendre transform of the Rényi function. For the Rényi function on the sphere, there are three models where the Rényi function is known explicitly. They are Log-Normal model, Log-Gamma model and Log-Negative-Inverted-Gamma model. Our research aims to check the Gaussianity of the CMB Radiation data collected from the Planck mission. We discuss the statistical properties of random fields on spheres using high frequency asymptotics for angular spectrum.<\/p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1568739308000,"duration":7200000,"id":"264928726","name":"Code & Coffee","rsvp_limit":16,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1569360600000,"local_date":"2019-09-24","local_time":"17:30","updated":1568739308000,"utc_offset":-14400000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":7,"venue":{"id":26122285,"name":"Good Karma Cafe","lat":39.9445152282715,"lon":-75.1578674316406,"repinned":true,"address_1":"928 Pine St","city":"Philadelphia","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"19107","state":"PA"},"group":{"created":1507729015000,"name":"R-Ladies Philly","id":26229746,"join_mode":"open","lat":40.1199989318848,"lon":-75.0100021362305,"urlname":"rladies-philly","who":"R-Ladies","localized_location":"Philadelphia, PA","state":"PA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Eastern"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/rladies-philly/events/264928726/","description":"<p>Join R-Ladies Philly for another evening of coffee, conversation, and coding!<\/p> <p>We will meet at Good Karma (928 Pine Street) from 5:30-7:30 PM on Tuesday August 24, 2019 for an informal opportunity to share current R projects with one another, debug and review code, and network (and of course indulge in delicious coffee and pastry).<\/p> <p>Please bring your laptop.

As a trained cellular biologist in a computational biology group, Joji is currently exploring big data tools to map out genomic marks of healthy and diseased cell states. Prior to moving to Copenhagen, Joji earned her Master’s at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, USA where she studied Patient-derived biospecimens from Parkinson’s disease patients and studied cellular marks related to cellular autophagy and UV damage in comparison to healthy age-match cohorts. As a “data science” noob, she takes on a different perspective on how data science tools can be applied in biology to study health and diseases.<\/p> <p>Our second speaker is Jhaz Petersen - a data-savvy Marketer who is a Graduate from Copenhagen Business School.

Along the way, she will discuss why each version of the plot fails in different ways and how each iteration improved on the last one.<\/p> <p>Alison is a data scientist &amp; professional educator at RStudio, where she works to help people learn and use programming to do better work in less time, with less friction, and (perhaps) more joy.

We will begin with the basics on networks and clustering before moving on to the algorithm and implementation that we chose to analyse the Scottish Economy. We then give an introduction to R Shiny, a package used to create interactive web apps, and show off our network visualisation and editing app. Finally, we will discuss how we can improve this ongoing project and future applications of our networking efforts in analysing the Scottish economy. We have used the `NetworkToolbox` library for the implementation of the main algorithm. The packages `dplyr` and `tidyr` were used for data manipulation, `plotly` and `igraph` are used for visualisations, and of course `Shiny` is used to build a convenient user interface. All data used will be made available for download, and the code will be shared via GitHub.<\/p> ","how_to_find_us":"Usha Kasera Lecture Theatre (entrance to the right via the Old College courtyard)","visibility":"public","pro_is_email_shared":false,"member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1563368765000,"duration":9000000,"id":"263223307","name":"Scotland Fintech - UiPath & VKY discuss Intelligent Automation","rsvp_limit":120,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1569519000000,"local_date":"2019-09-26","local_time":"18:30","updated":1568449046000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":53,"venue":{"id":25929201,"name":"Bayes Centre","lat":55.9449348449707,"lon":-3.18643403053284,"repinned":true,"address_1":"47 Potterrow","city":"Edinburgh","country":"gb","localized_country_name":"United Kingdom"},"group":{"created":1428405374000,"name":"Scotland Data Science & Technology Meetup","id":18536740,"join_mode":"approval","lat":55.9500007629395,"lon":-3.22000002861023,"urlname":"Scotland-Data-Science-Technology-Meetup","who":"Data & Technology enthusiasts","localized_location":"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","state":"U8","country":"gb","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/London"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Scotland-Data-Science-Technology-Meetup/events/263223307/","description":"<p>Scotland Fintech Festival - FinTech Scotland - <a href=\"https://www.fintechscotland.com/scotland-fintech-festival/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.fintechscotland.com/scotland-fintech-festival/<\/a><\/p> <p>Scotland Fintech Festival will take place in September 2019 between the 9th and the 27th across Scotland.<\/p> <p>The festival will contain conferences, meet-ups, morning breakfast sessions, evening networking events and much more.<\/p> <p>Scotland Data Science &amp; Technology Meetup are delighted to have Doug Gowans - Technical Partner Manager - UiPath Alex Croucher - Director - VKY Intelligent Automation presenting.<\/p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Presentation 1 - Bringing an automation first mindset to finance.

I will be presenting some examples.<\/p> <p>Abstract<br/>Data wrangling is a critical foundation of data science, and wrangling of categorical data is an important component of this process. However, categorical data can introduce unique issues in data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper discusses common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the ‘tidyverse.’ We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.<\/p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false},{"created":1567797975000,"duration":7200000,"id":"264625131","name":"Intro to R","rsvp_limit":35,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1569546000000,"local_date":"2019-09-26","local_time":"18:00","updated":1567797975000,"utc_offset":-25200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":19,"venue":{"id":26152288,"name":"Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center","lat":47.6272621154785,"lon":-122.331489562988,"repinned":false,"address_1":"1100 Fairview Ave N","city":"Seattle","country":"us","localized_country_name":"USA","zip":"98109","state":"WA"},"group":{"created":1260576800000,"name":"Seattle useR Group (R Programming Language)","id":1568445,"join_mode":"open","lat":47.6599998474121,"lon":-122.290000915527,"urlname":"Seattle-useR","who":"Seattle Area useRs","localized_location":"Seattle, WA","state":"WA","country":"us","region":"en_US","timezone":"US/Pacific"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-useR/events/264625131/","description":"<p>This is intended to give a crash course to R users with none/little experience with R or programming, and end with visualizing a dataset.

From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.<\/p> <p>Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women†‹, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.\"<\/p> ","how_to_find_us":"We will be either inside or outside with at least one copy of the book","visibility":"public","pro_is_email_shared":false,"member_pay_fee":false}]],"container":"<table class=\"display fill-container\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id<\/th>\n      <th>name<\/th>\n      <th>created<\/th>\n      <th>status<\/th>\n      <th>time<\/th>\n      <th>local_date<\/th>\n      <th>local_time<\/th>\n      <th>waitlist_count<\/th>\n      <th>yes_rsvp_count<\/th>\n      <th>venue_id<\/th>\n      <th>venue_name<\/th>\n      <th>venue_lat<\/th>\n      <th>venue_lon<\/th>\n      <th>venue_address_1<\/th>\n      <th>venue_city<\/th>\n      <th>venue_state<\/th>\n      <th>venue_zip<\/th>\n      <th>venue_country<\/th>\n      <th>description<\/th>\n      <th>link<\/th>\n      <th>resource<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"scrollY":200,"scroller":true,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-left","targets":[0,1,2,3]},{"className":"dt-right","targets":[7,8,9,11,12]}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
